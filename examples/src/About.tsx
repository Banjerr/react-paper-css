      <h2>Differences to PaperCSS</h2>
      <p>
        Let me quote the original PaperCSS{" "}
        <a href="https://www.getpapercss.com/about/">about page</a>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The goal of PaperCSS is to be as minimal as possible when adding
        classes. For example, a button should just look like a paper button.
        There shouldnâ€™t be a need to add a class such as{" "}
        <code>paper-button</code>. Because of this, adding PaperCSS to a
        markdown generated page should instantly paper-ize it.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This may not be the best thing when you want to build an app quickly. If
        you want to use Comic Sans in place of default font with a CSS framework
        you can either fork it or override each selector that sets the font,
        what is not fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        In PaperCSS React, you get only what you ask for. Need only a button?
        Great, just <code>{"import { Button }"}</code> and you have it.
